# Puzzle Solver

## Description
This program is an IQ Puzzle Pro Solver that finds solutions using a brute-force search algorithm. It uses Java for the core puzzle-solving logic and JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI). The backend handles puzzle file processing and solution generation, while the frontend provides an interactive interface for loading puzzles, visualizing solutions, and exporting results. The interface includes a toolbar with buttons to load and save files, a canvas for visualization, and a text area for displaying information.
